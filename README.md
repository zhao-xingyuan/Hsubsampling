This repository is forked from "https://github.com/zhao-xingyuan/MUST.git" with the following updates:
1. correction of a bug for the utility experiment 3 of the logistic regression
2. addition of the code for the MNIST experiment ("MUST_MNIST.ipynb")
3. update the implementation of the privacy profile for the Gaussian mechanism in the utility experiment 3 using the formula in Theorem 1 in "Balle, Borja, and Yu-Xiang Wang. "Improving the gaussian mechanism for differential privacy: Analytical calibration and optimal denoising." In International Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 394-403. PMLR, 2018."
4. update the implementation of gradient calculation in DP-SGD to use a weighted average of the gradients from unique samples.
